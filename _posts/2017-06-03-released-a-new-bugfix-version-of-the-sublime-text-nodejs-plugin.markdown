I've just released a new bugfix version of the [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) Nodejs [plugin](https://github.com/tanepiper/SublimeText-Nodejs/). Should say, this is a first version, since that moment when I started porting the plugin to the version 3 of Sublime Text, when all features working out of the box either installed by the Package Control or manually. 

List of bug fixes:

* Fix issue-63. Now can run built-in tools, when the package is installed by Package Control. [See more at GitHub](https://github.com/tanepiper/SublimeText-Nodejs/issues/63)
* Fix issue-65. Now the package resolves correct path for built-in tools. [See more at GitHub](https://github.com/tanepiper/SublimeText-Nodejs/issues/65)
