<a href="https://cc.readytalk.com/cc/s/registrations/new?cid=nxamkt682kik">From the Front Lines: Opening Acts - How Attackers Get Their Big Breaks</a><br/><h3>Meeting Description:</h3>
<div id="meeting-description">
<div>Every security incident has to start somewhere. Sometimes the attacker gets into an organization via phishing. Other times they use SQL injection. Or, they may use an off-the-shelf exploit kit, mass malware, drive-by attack, ‘l33t zero-day exploits, access via other compromises, or some other technique like 2014’s vulnerability à la mode: HeartBleed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Join Mandiant’s Evan Peña and Chuck Willis as they discuss the <strong>recent trends and novel techniques in how attackers gain their initial foothold in victim networks</strong>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This webinar will cover:</div>
<div>
<ul><li>Specific case studies that illustrate the types of vulnerabilities and systems targeted by attackers</li>
<li>Methods to prevent intrusions using the different vectors, along with potential mechanisms to detect the attacks</li>
<li>Tools used by the attackers and how to replicate the incidents</li>
</ul></div>
<div>As always, we will leave plenty of time for Q &amp; A.</div>
</div>
